## Capstone Project
### Forecasting Civil Unrest

#### Problem Statement:

- Is there any pattern we can learn to forecast social unrest events from the
data in our day-to-day life, such as general social sentiment, economic, or
political developments?
- Given a location (i.e. country, city), can we predict the weekly CU event counts
accurately in advance?
